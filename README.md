# murmur3Hash_dumper
simple command line tool used in my research for halo infinite.
basically my weird take on trying to brute force reversing hashes

essentially what this tool tries to achieve
- reverse murmur3 hashes by stripping all the keywords/strings from selected files, hash them, and then assort them into a large database

murmur3 code derived from https://gist.github.com/automatonic/3725443
